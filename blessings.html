      from the President</font></u></b></strong></font></p>

    <p class="style4"  > <font size="3"> Education does not serve a single purpose; 
      instead, it serves manifold objectives. It has been a remedy; a solution 
      to all problems across the world - be them social, economic, educational, 
      political, technological, or cultural. Thus, Education has been the key 
      to success in human life. Hence, by availing education opportunities to 
      all, the society gives everyone an equal opportunity to succeed in life. 
      <br>
      I strongly believe that the core objectives of education should be: to prepare 
      children for citizenship, to cultivate a skilled workforce for the socio-economic 
      growth of the country, and to prepare the students for competition in a 
      global marketplace. In fact, the purpose of education should be focused 
      more on social, academic, cultural and intellectual development so that 
      students can grow up to be engaged citizens.<strong> In short, Education 
      should prepare young people for life, work and citizenship.</strong> <br>
      With the same philosophy, <strong>Charotar University of Science and Technology 
      (CHARUSAT) </strong>has been established to put India on a Global Education 
      Hub through creation, augmentation and dissemination of knowledge. Since 
      inception, CHARUSAT has been redefining and redesigning higher and professional 
      education. <br>
      It focuses on converting eyes into sight and vision; information into knowledge 
      and wisdom; and demography into citizens and harmonious living. Teachers 
      also dedicate their efforts to construct and facilitate opportunities where 
      the students can practice and experience creativity. Moving a step ahead 
      towards the purpose of education, CHARUSAT aims to make its students Job 
      Creators and not Job Seekers. <br>
      Further, CHARUSAT strongly believes in the ideals of Sardar Vallabhbhai 
      Patel - The Iron Man of India. He believed, "Education without character 
      is futile". In order to inculcate right values in the students, CHARUSAT 
      has been established as a University fostering <strong>High Moral and Ethical 
      Values</strong>. <br>
      Research, particularly, socially relevant research has been the buzzword 
      at CHARUSAT. A Research and Development Centre has been established on the 
      Campus. Further, to initiate and foster research in Space Technology, <strong>Charusat 
      Space Research and Technology Center (CSRTC)</strong> has also been established. 
      It works in close collaboration with ISRO. <br>
      CHARUSAT also fosters a niche for world class education at the rural base. 
      In the long run, it aspires to be a <strong>World Class University</strong>. 
      Primarily, it strives to be in the league of Top 20 Universities at National 
      Level. It has also charted out Road Map. <br>
      As a step in the direction, CHARUSAT has achieved the milestone achievement 
      of being the First Private University of Gujarat by securing A Grade in 
      the first cycle of assessment by National Assessment and Accreditation Council 
      (NAAC), Bangalore. <br>
      I am happy that continuing the march towards excellence in<strong> Education 
      and Research</strong>, CHARUSAT has initiated the Publication of a <strong>Research 
      Journal</strong>. I believe that it really proves to be an appropriate platform 
      for all to share their knowledge and innovations. <br>
      My best wishes and blessings for the initiative of publishing <strong>CHARUSAT 
      JOURNAL!</strong> <br>

      First (Honorary) Provost, CHARUSAT </font></u></b></strong></font></p>

    <p class="style4" align="justify"  > <font size="3"> Dear Readers, <br> Higher Education has always 
      been a pre-requisite and also a foundation of all knowledge, discoveries, 
      innovations, entrepreneurship, and hence, of National Development. In recent 
      years, India has definitely met commendable improvements and advancements 
      particularly in providing society at large the access to tertiary education. 
      However, considerable challenges still persist. QS World University Rankings 
      2016-17 clearly indicate that Indian Universities hardly find their place 
      in the Top 500 World Class Universities or struggle to retain the previous 
      Ranks. <br>
      Hence, Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT) has been 
      conceived by <strong>Shri Charotar Moti Sattavis Patidar Kelavani Mandal</strong> 
      to put India on global education map by making <strong>Charotar </strong>- 
      the Land of Sardar Patel <strong>the Global Education Hub</strong>. Kelavani 
      Mandal is a premier education trust of India. It has an ancestry of social 
      service of more than 122 years old social organization <em>- Shri Charotar 
      Moti Sattavis Leuva Patidar Samaj - Matrusanstha.</em> <br>
	  CHARUSAT has been 
      established by inclusion in the Schedule vide Section 3(1) of Gujarat Private 
      University Act No. 8 of 2009. It is empowered to confer degrees under Section 
      22 of UGC Act 1956. It is the state university getting "A+" Grade in 
      the second cycle by National Assessment and Accreditation Council, NAAC, 
      Bangalore. It is also accredited with Grade "A" by Knowledge Consortium 
      of Gujarat, Government of Gujarat. <br> Presently, CHARUSAT offers 70 programs 
      from Undergraduate, Postgraduate to Doctoral (Ph D) under the tutelage of 
      9 Institutes, 6 Faculties, 4 Centres / Cells, employee strength of 550, 
      student strength of 6500 and a Capital Outlay of Rs. 150 Crores. They are 
      in the allied disciplines of Engineering & Technology, Pharmacy, Computer 
      Applications, Management, Applied Sciences, Nursing, Physiotherapy, and 
      other Paramedical Sciences. <br> As a University, CHARUSAT intends not just to 
      hand a map to those willing to follow it, but to inculcate leadership and 
      restlessness into a new generation. Hence, it endeavors to serve the society 
      by striving to transform it through creation, augmentation, dissemination 
      and perpetuation of knowledge.<strong> Therefore, the thrust at CHARUSAT, is on 
      socially relevant Research & Development</strong>. <br> To further accelerate interdisciplinary 
      research activities at CHARUSAT, various initiatives have been taken. As 
      a result, <strong>18 Patents</strong> have been filed and / or held by the students and faculty 
      members of CHARUSAT. Further, CHARUSAT emphasizes, facilitates and encourages 
      faculty members to conduct applied research and undertake industry relevant 
      projects. For the purpose, highly sophisticated Research and Testing Labs 
      have also been established at CHARUSAT Campus. <br> <strong>Dr. K. C. Patel R & D Centre</strong> 
      has been established for focused research in physics and its applications 
      in varied fields. It was established in 2006 when, in the Education Scenario 
      of Gujarat, Research was not so sung a buzz word. Further, <strong>CHARUSAT Space 
      Research Technology Centre</strong> has been established in collaboration with ISRO 
      for focused collaborative research and training of students in space technology. 
      CHARUSAT, at present, has on hand, 40 ongoing <strong>research projects </strong>of around 
      Rs. 7.49 crores from funding agencies like DST/DBT, GUJCOST, UGC, DAE, SERI, 
      CSIR, ABB, DNP Industry, GSBTM, CHARUSAT and many more in addition to 11 
      completed Projects worth Rs. 2.2 crore since 2009. It also has 52.6 lakhs 
      Projects of Industry, Consultancy and Modrob Grants exceeding Rs. 34.5 lakhs. 
      <br> Importantly, the university supports research projects of the students (UG 
      as well as PG and Doctoral students) by giving them financial support. The 
      cost of testing facilities availed outside CHARUSAT is also reimbursed. 
      <br> Endowment Chairs are also established. Experts of eminence from around the 
      World are invited to share their knowledge and skills. Quite uniquely, Dr. 
      APJ Abdul Kalam Chair has been established. Padma Shri A S Kiran Kumar, 
      Chairman, ISRO and Secretary, Department of Space visited CHARUSAT. He also 
      delivered the inaugural and motivational / enlightening lecture on Space 
      Technology and Development. <br> In order to promote research and innovation, 
      in the very first year of its inception, CHARUSAT launched Ph D program. 
      So far, 23 Scholars have been awarded with the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. 
      In addition, presently, more than 240 Research Scholars are pursuing their 
      Ph D from CHARUSAT. Distinctively, CHARUSAT has also initiated Post-Doctoral 
      Fellowships, Best Research Paper Award, Patent and Intellectual Property 
      Policy, and Collaborations. <br>
      Present Development at CHARUSAT Campus is indebted to renowned nuclear scientist 
      and a prominent educationist of Gujarat, <strong>Dr. K C Patel</strong>, 
      Former President of Kelavani Mandal who actually dreamt of a University 
      at CHARUSAT Campus, Changa. Shri Surendra Patel, President of Kelavani Mandal 
      and CHARUSAT has also always insisted on High Academic and Research Standards 
      and Self-Reliance. <br> Further, Dr. B G Patel, Provost, CHARUSAT is also a good 
      mix of Academics, Research and Administration who took the University on 
      the next level of development. Equally, enthusiast and encouraging has been 
      the Registrar of CHARUSAT - Devang Joshi. He has also been striving very 
      hard to promote interdisciplinary research. Further, CHARUSAT has been a 
      very Unique University. <strong>It follows the Founding High Moral and Ethical Values.</strong> 
      Honesty, Integrity, and Transparency have been the benchmarks of CHARUSAT 
      in both word and action. And hence, it works in synchronization with all 
      of its stakeholders. <br>In the long run, CHARUSAT fosters an aspiration of 
      being a <strong>World Class University</strong>. It strives, initially, to be in the league 
      of <strong>Top 20 Universities at National Level.</strong> CHARUSAT wishes to achieve it 
      through hybrid culture: A culture that represents the serenity of the oldest 
      places of learning like Takshashila and Nalanda and the scholarship of the 
      centres like Harvard and Stanford.<br>Finally, it is my heartfelt desire and 
      faith that one day <strong>CHARUSAT will produce a Nobel Laureate</strong>. <br> In the Journey 
      towards the fulfillment of these Dreams, <strong>CHARUSAT Journal </strong>is an important 
      landmark. I hope it contributes in the creation and dissemination of knowledge 
      and becomes an effective for the upliftment of modern sciences. <br> My best 
      wishes and congratulations to the Team !<br>Regards, <br>
      <em><strong>Dr. M C Patel</strong></em> </p>
